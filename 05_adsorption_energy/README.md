In this section, we will see how to calculate the adsorption energy. In general, the adsorption energy is defined by the equation 
$$
\displaystyle E_{ads} = E_{*A} - E_{*} - E_{A}
$$
where $E_{*A}$ is the energy of the complex system, while E_{*} and E_{A} is the energy of the substrate and the isolate adsorbate, respectively. 

In this section, the CO adsorption on Cu(100) will be taken as an example.
