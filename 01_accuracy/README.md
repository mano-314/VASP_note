In this section, we will see how to control the accuracy of our calculations.
It is easy to get a number from the calculation. But to get the "approproate" number is not that easy. 
For plane wave calculation, it is important to check the convergence respect to the number of k-point and 
the energy cutoff. 

1. The convergence test on k-point 
2. The convergence test on energy cutoff 

In most calculations in our field, the concept of charge is important in explaning mechanism 
of mechanism of interest. For example, if we do the calculation on Bader charge 
[J. Chem. Phys. 134, 064111 (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3553716), then the selection of grid will affect 
the accuracy of the real space integration. This will be demonstrated in section 

3. The convergence of atomic charge on grid size 
And the accuracy of force on real-space projection method 
4. The accuracy of forces on real-space projection
